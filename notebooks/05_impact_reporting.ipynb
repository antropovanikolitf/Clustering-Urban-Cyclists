    "\n",
    "Through **5 capstones**, we:\n",
    "1. **Framed the problem** (stakeholders, hypotheses, ethics)\n",
    "2. **Prepared the data** (cleaning, features, EDA)\n",
    "3. **Experimented with algorithms** (K-Means, Agglo, DBSCAN)\n",
    "4. **Evaluated & visualized** (PCA, metrics, characteristics)\n",

    "✅ **$5M invested in protected bike lanes** → safer commuting for 40% of riders\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **200 new stations in underserved areas** → equitable access for all NYC\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Bike + Transit integration** → seamless multimodal trips, reduced car dependence\n",
