    "### Evaluation Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quantitative Metrics**:\n",
    "- Silhouette score: {metrics['silhouette']:.4f} {'(PASS ≥0.35)' if metrics['silhouette'] >= 0.35 else '(FAIL <0.35)'}\n",
    "- Davies-Bouldin: {metrics['davies_bouldin']:.4f} {'(PASS <1.5)' if metrics['davies_bouldin'] < 1.5 else '(FAIL ≥1.5)'}\n",
    "- Calinski-Harabasz: {metrics['calinski_harabasz']:.1f} (higher is better)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Qualitative Assessment**:\n",
    "- Clusters are **interpretable** (align with commuter/tourist/last-mile hypotheses)\n",
    "- PCA projection shows **visible separation** (though overlap exists)\n",
    "- Cluster sizes are **reasonably balanced** (no cluster <5% or >70%)\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Limitations**:\n",
    "1. **PCA captures only {pca_model.explained_variance_ratio_[:2].sum()*100:.1f}% of variance** in 2D\n",
    "   - Some cluster separation may exist in higher dimensions\n",
    "   - 2D visualization is inherently lossy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overlap in PCA space** doesn't mean poor clustering\n",
    "   - Clusters may be separated in original 7D space\n",
    "   - PCA optimizes for variance, not cluster separation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpretability subjective**\n",
    "   - Cluster names based on heuristics (not ground truth)\n",
    "   - Real-world validation needed (user surveys, operator feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Important Features** (from PCA):\n",
    "- PC1 likely separates by **trip duration/distance** (long vs short trips)\n",
    "- PC2 likely separates by **time** (weekday/weekend, hour of day)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Insights**:\n",
    "- [Review char_table and note key patterns: e.g., \"Cluster 0 (Commuters) shows 90% weekday, 80% members, peak at hour 8\"]\n",
    "- [Identify unexpected findings from section H]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actionability\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Stakeholder Value**:\n",
    "- City planners can use cluster maps to prioritize infrastructure (bike lanes, stations)\n",
    "- Operators can tailor pricing and marketing by cluster\n",
    "- Advocates can quantify impact (e.g., \"40% of trips are commuters → XX tons CO₂ saved\")\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ **Caveats**:\n",
    "- Seasonal bias (spring/summer data)\n",
    "- Geographic skew (Manhattan/Brooklyn dominant)\n",
